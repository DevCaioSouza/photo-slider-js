Hi!<br>
This is a single page application that showcases a photo slider made using JavaScript and HTML<br>
The photos are changed by clicking or dragging the range input button<br>

To be fair, i don't think "slider" is the most appropriate name to describe it, but it was the closest idea that i had<br>
Suggestions to what it should be called are totally accepted! :)
